Hi, it's me. This is my profile. 
What do I do? Depends on who you ask. Either nothing or everything.

Blender. Photoshop. Illustrator. Unity. Substance Painter. Java and Python hell. A dabble of SOLIDWORKS.

learning some cpp with webgl/opengl projects. 
can you see them? no.
learning about the McCumber Cube
Modeling, creating games, and losing my braincells in university.
