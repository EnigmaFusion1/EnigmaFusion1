Hi, it's me. This is my profile. 
What do I do? Depends on who you ask. Either nothing or everything.

Blender. Photoshop. Illustrator. Unity. Substance Painter. 

still stuck in java while learning some cpp.

Modeling, creating games, and losing my braincells in university classes.

What I'm listening to...
